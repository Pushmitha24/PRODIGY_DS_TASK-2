# PRODIGY_DS_TASK-2
Completed my second task data cleaning and exploratory data analysis
using jupyter .
In this i have made use of kaggle train and survival dataset 🚊
from which i was able to experiment various factor like :
*the survival rate in each age group,survival rate in both genders 👻 👻
*a pie chart visualization to show the rates of survival from the cities they
belong to. ✈ ✈
Also was able to find the various errors and inconsistency. ❌
Overall gained the experience in the process of cleaning data using jupyter.
